*About the app B-E-V*

During the investment approach, there are many questions that rises whether to sell, buy, or hold stocks.
- What stocks do I purchase to make profit?
- When is it the right time to buy?
- When is the right time to sell?

Under those circumstances, the investor visits multiple pages and gathers information from many sources.



With the enhanced realtime data polling, the results are processed, serviced and rendered for the user. With the fast-phased graphical analyse, it becomes easier to get the current recommended action (whether to buy, sell or hold stocks), earning estimation analyse dating back to as early as year 2000, and the latest stock prices for the chosen company thus all the previous stock prices dating back to year 1970.


B-E-V provides you with a comprehensive insight into companies of your choice. Follow the company's development.
